    Official Rules:
</p>
<p id="p1">
    - This game, Connect-Four, is a tic-tac-toe game played by two players.<br/><br/>
    - In this game, the players take turns placing pieces on a vertical board.<br/><br/>
    - The board is seven columns long and six rows high.<br/><br/>
    - Each player uses pieces of a specific color, usually black and red or sometimes yellow and red.<br/><br/>
    - The goal is to be the first to get four pieces in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line.<br/><br/>
    - Since the board is vertical, parts inserted in a certain column always fall in the lowest unoccupied row in that column.<br/><br/>
    - As soon as a column contains six parts, it is full, and no further parts can be placed on the column.<br/><br/>
    - Both the players begin with 21 similar pieces, and the first player to reach a series of four connected pieces wins the game.<br/><br/>
    - If all the men have played and neither player has four parts in a row, the game is a tie.<br/><br/>
    - While Tic-Tac-Toe is the original game of getting pieces in a row, Connect 4 is another classic strategy game.<br/><br/>
    - Connect four is reminiscent of checkers and requires a lot of foresight.<br/><br/>

    Official Rules:<br><br>

    - This game, Connect-Four, is a tic-tac-toe game played by two players.<br /><br />
    - In this game, the players take turns placing pieces on a vertical board.<br /><br />
    - This board is five columns long and five rows high.<br /><br />
    - Each player uses pieces of a specific color. In this case, red or blue.<br /><br />
    - The goal is to be the first to get four pieces in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line.<br /><br />
    - Since the board is vertical, parts inserted in a certain column always fall in the lowest unoccupied row in that column.<br /><br />
    - As soon as a column contains five parts, it is full, and no further parts can be placed on the column.<br /><br />
    - Both players begin with the same amount of pieces, and the first player to reach a series of four connected pieces wins the game.<br /><br />
    - If all pucks have been played and neither player has four parts in a row, the game is a tie.<br /><br />
    - While Tic-Tac-Toe is the original game of getting pieces in a row, Connect 4 is another classic strategy game.<br /><br />
    - Connect four is reminiscent of checkers and requires good foresight.<br /><br />
